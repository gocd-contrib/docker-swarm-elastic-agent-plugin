## Installation

Documentation for installation is available [here](INSTALL.md).

## Building the code base

To build the jar, run `./gradlew clean test assemble`

## Using your own docker image with elastic agents

More information to build custom GoCD agent docker image is available [here](https://github.com/gocd/docker-gocd-agent)

## Troubleshooting

If you already have it running it on a mac, make sure to restart it (see https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues/17#mobyaccess). Time drift is known to cause the plugin to not work, because the timestamps returned by the docker API has drifted from the host.

A good way to know if there's a time drift is to run `docker ps` —

    ```
    CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES
    e0754c9f4cdb        alpine:latest       "/bin/sh"           32 minutes ago      Up 17 seconds                           test
    809f310ba1e4        ubuntu:trusty       "/bin/bash"         33 minutes ago      Up About a minute                       reverent_raman
    ```

Notice how the `CREATED` and `STATUS` are several minutes apart for a recently created container.

### Enabling debug level logging

#### If you are on GoCD version 19.6 and above:

Edit the file `wrapper-properties.conf` on your GoCD server and add the following options. The location of the `wrapper-properties.conf` can be found in the [installation documentation](https://docs.gocd.org/current/installation/installing_go_server.html) of the GoCD server.

```properties
# We recommend that you begin with the index `100` and increment the index for each system property
wrapper.java.additional.100=-Dplugin.cd.go.contrib.elastic-agent.docker-swarm.log.level=debug
```

If you're running with GoCD server 19.6 and above on docker using one of the supported GoCD server images, set the environment variable `GOCD_SERVER_JVM_OPTIONS`:

```shell
docker run -e "GOCD_SERVER_JVM_OPTIONS=-Dplugin.cd.go.contrib.elastic-agent.docker-swarm.log.level=debug" ...
```

#### If you are on GoCD version 19.5 and lower: 

Enabling debug level logging can help you troubleshoot an issue with the elastic agent plugin. To enable debug level logs, edit the `/etc/default/go-server` (for Linux) to add:

```bash
export GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES="$GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES -Dplugin.cd.go.contrib.elastic-agent.docker-swarm.log.level=debug"
```

If you're running the server via `./server.sh` script —

```
$ GO_SERVER_SYSTEM_PROPERTIES="-Dplugin.cd.go.contrib.elastic-agent.docker-swarm.log.level=debug" ./server.sh
```
